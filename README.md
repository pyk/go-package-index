This script generates csv to `stdout`. The csv output contains some
information about package such as `package path`, `host`, `owner`
and `name of the repo`.

The data is from [Godoc Index][index]. Only packages that hosted on github or
bitbucket is collected.

I created this to collect data for research purpose.
